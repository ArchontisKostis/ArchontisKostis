## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
Hi there! My name is Archontis Kostis and I am a software developer from Thessaloniki, Greece. I have always had a passion for computers and programming, and this passion has only grown stronger as I've progressed through my bachelor studies at the [University of Macedonia (Department of Applied Informatics)](https://www.uom.gr/dai).

In my free time, I enjoy participating in open source projects and tinkering with new technologies. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games, watching movies, or exploring the latest gadgets. Technology has always been a major interest of mine, dating back to my early days as a computer enthusiast.

I am dedicated to constantly learning and growing as a developer, and I hope you'll join me on this journey of learning and discovery by checking out my projects on GitHub. Thank you for visiting my profile!
